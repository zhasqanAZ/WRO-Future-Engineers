## 💡 Project Overview

Our project is an **autonomous vehicle** designed to navigate and react to its environment using intelligent sensing and control systems.

The car is built on a **custom LEGO chassis**, powered by an **Arduino-based PopXT Bot/ Arduino Leonardo board**, and equipped with a **HuskyLens AI camera** for object detection and line tracking.

This system demonstrates the integration of hardware, AI, and mechanical design to create a functional and adaptable autonomous robot.
