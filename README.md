# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Aigerim**, and I am **17 years old**.

This is my **second adventure** in the **WRO (World Robot Olympiad)** â€” a journey that fuels my passion for innovation and technology.

My first experience was back in **Grade 9**, when I took on the challenge of the **RoboMission category (Senior Division)**.  
That experience sparked my love for robotics and teamwork.

Now, I'm excited to take things to the next level as I dive into the **Future Engineers** category â€” where creativity, design, and real-world engineering come together! ðŸš€
